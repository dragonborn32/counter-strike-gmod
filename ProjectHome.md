A re-creation of the popular online game for Garry's Mod 10. It plans to have compatibility with Counter-Strike: Source maps and have support for defusal, hostage rescue and assassination maps.

As well as a ton of weapons including the old favourites the AK-47, M4A1 and the AWP. It will be as close to the original as possible but ironing out all the problems that come with it too.
